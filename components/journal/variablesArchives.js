    foremost on the possible mechanism responsible for picking
     up and transporting the horizontal game pieces. They are conflicted 
    between two models: the first is omnidirectional, but 
    the second's linear motion allows it to be extremely meticulous. 
    The base that had been previously saved was too small 
    for its wheels and was therefore rebuilt on a smaller scale.`
